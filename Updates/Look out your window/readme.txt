Decorate your window with different items and different people and creatures may come to visit. There are currently 2 to encounter! I plan to add more in future updates.

Psst- press f12 to toggle dev mode and enjoy my awful placeholder sprites! Might be slightly weird in some cases but shouldn't break anything.

Made by the Nameless One for the Idea Adoption Jam 2025! Inspired by an idea from Kipali.
